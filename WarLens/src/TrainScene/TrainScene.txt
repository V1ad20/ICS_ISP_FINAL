This is so unfair.

What if we never see him again?

I know Gleb, I know.

We didn't even do anything and we're being punished!

He wanted to fight, and we had to respect that.

Your dad loves us and his country. He wanted to make sure we'll have something to
come back to.

It's very hard for me to do this, but I feel that it is my duty to stay back
and help defend my country.

This means that you will have to be strong, my boy.
Your mother and sister will be counting on you.

I trust that you will be able to bring them to safety
and that you will help them start over.

You must persevere and never second- guess yourself.
Work hard at things and follow your instinct.

Since you were born, you have always been alert, so I know
you will be very perceptive about things.

Don't lose faith that I will come back, because when all this is over,
we will live together again in peace.

And never forget that I love you very much.
