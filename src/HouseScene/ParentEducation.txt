Alright, we can't say we're glad to hear that, but I know how you are Gleb.
You bottle things up and let whatever's bothering you get the best of you.

Although doing well in school is important,
doing bad on a test is not the end of the world.

It is important to take deep breaths first, and then think rationally.
Will this be on your mind in a year, or even a month?
What can I do about it right now?

the internet for strategies to deal with stress.

According to this article by America's Center for Disease Control,
looks like I was right. Deep breaths and rational thinking are the ways to
go.

You must also remember what is truly important in your life, Gleb.
Ukranians know suffering. War, occupation, famine-you name it,
and a Ukrainian has endured it.

Yet we are still here, and we did this by
surrounding ourselves with the people we love.
With family comes strength, and with this strength you triumph.

Also, ask your teacher what you can do to raise your grade.
You must learn to communicate effectively with others.

Also, don’t forget the amazing technology we have.
These days, you can find anything on the internet.

Remember, things will not just happen for you,
you need to take initiative. Know what is going on around you,
and when an opportunity presents itself, seize it.

Tomorrow morning, we will go to your teacher and discuss what you can do, alright?

Alright, sounds good.

Great. Speaking of which, its pretty late. Go off to bed, but be quiet because
your sister is sleeping.
